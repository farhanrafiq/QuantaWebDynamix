Create a one-page, infinitely scrolling, fully responsive website for “QuantaFONS Pvt. Ltd.”—a cutting-edge R&D company specializing in high-end civil-engineering data projects and AI-driven structural-health monitoring. **Use only vector illustrations and CSS/WebGL animations; no photos.** Style guide: dark-mode base (#0D0F12), neon accents (electric blue, magenta), bold white typography (Helvetica Neue or Inter), micro-interactions on hover/click.  

**1. Hero Section**  
• Full-viewport gradient background with subtly animated flowing data-stream lines.  
• Central headline (H1) “Quantum-Powered Insights • Real-Time Structural Intelligence” fading in letter by letter.  
• Subheading with typing effect: “AI • Nano-Sensors • PTFE-Enhanced Waterproofing • Digital Twin Analytics.”  
• Animated “Request Demo” button with pulsing neon border.  

**2. About Us**  
• Animated infographic timeline: “Founded 2024 → PTFE Waterproofing R&D → Quantum-Fiber SHM Launch → AI-Analytics Platform.”  
• On-scroll reveal of each milestone with Lottie-style icons and connector lines that draw themselves.  

**3. Core Capabilities**  
Arrange four cards in a horizontal scroll carousel (mouse-wheel enabled), each animating in 3D tilt on hover:  
  1. **PTFE-Nano Waterproofing** – icon of animated molecular lattice  
  2. **Quantum Fiber Sensors** – glowing fiber-optic cable weaving across the card  
  3. **AI Analytics Engine** – real-time bar/line chart morphing between states  
  4. **Digital Twin Simulation** – wireframe building rotating in 3D  

**4. Live Data Visualizations**  
Embed three animated canvas or WebGL charts side by side:  
  - Real-time strain vs. time (scrolling line graph)  
  - Corrosion risk heatmap on a simplified slab model  
  - Carbonation depth profile as an animated area chart  
Charts slide in from the left as soon as they enter the viewport.  

**5. Case Studies Preview**  
Three panel slider with subtle parallax:  
  - “Mumbai Metro Waterproofing” – vector city background with droplet repelled animation  
  - “Delhi Airport Runway SHM” – animated loading-bar style structural scan  
  - “Hyderabad High-Rise Digital Twin” – rotating wireframe tower with data annotations  
Each panel expands on click into a modal with further animated infographics.  

**6. Technology Stack & R&D**  
Grid of logos (custom line-art SVGs) for: Python, TensorFlow, Node.js, WebGL, Three.js, D3.js, SolidWorks, COMSOL. On hover, each logo pulses and displays a tooltip with 2-sentence description.  

**7. Team & Lab**  
Circular animated portraits (vector avatars) of founder and lead engineers, each orbiting a miniature animated gear system behind them. Clicking opens a micro-bio overlay with Lottie-icon bullet points (PhD in Civil Eng., 12+ patents, etc.).  

**8. Contact / Demo Request**  
Full-width background of animated data particles drifting upward. A two-column form:  
  • Left: animated checklist of “Your Industry,” “Project Type,” “Budget Range” with slide-in arrows.  
  • Right: input fields and a glowing “Submit” button that morphs into a checkmark on success.  

**Global Animations & Micro-Interactions**  
• Smooth scroll with ease-in-out curves.  
• Cursor-tracking subtle parallax on all vector backgrounds.  
• Section anchors animate scroll progress indicator at top.  
• All buttons and links have neon-glow hover states, ripple effects on click.  

**SEO & Performance**  
• Lazy-load all animations and code-split to minimize initial payload.  
• Include meta tags: title, description, Open Graph with animated SVG preview.  
• Accessibility: keyboard-navigable, ARIA labels on all interactive elements.
